## BASIC EMACS COMMANDS

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is Emacs
Who is Richard Stallman
How to open and save files
What is a buffer and how to switch from one to the other
How to use the mark and the point to set the region
How to cut and paste lines and regions
How to search forward and backward
How to invoke commands by name
How to undo
How to cancel half-entered commands
How to quit Emacs

## REQUIREMENTS

All tasks must be done inside the sandbox Ubuntu 20.04
Your sandbox must be available at the end of this project - the Checker will access to it at midnight for running the correction!
The answer of a task must be in a specific file
Each answer file must contain only the command to execute in Emacs for solving the task. Example: “What is the command to write buffer to a specified file?” -> the file should contain only C-x C-w
